    Basic Operators in kotlin
        Arithmetic Operators:
            + (Addition)
            - (Subtraction)
            * (Multiplication)
            / (Division)
            % (Modulus)

        Assignment Operators:
            = (Assigns a value to a variable)
            +=, -=, *=, /=, %= (Compound assignment operators, e.g., a += b is equivalent to a = a + b)
       Comparison Operators:
            == (Equality)
            != (Inequality)
            < (Less than)
            > (Greater than)
            <= (Less than or equal to)
            >= (Greater than or equal to)
        Logical Operators:
            && (Logical AND)
            || (Logical OR)
            ! (Logical NOT)
        Range Operator:
            .. (Creates a range)


        Bitwise Operators (Intermediate level):
            shl (Signed shift left)
            shr (Signed shift right)
            ushr (Unsigned shift right)
            and (Bitwise AND)
            or (Bitwise OR)
            xor (Bitwise XOR)
            inv (Bitwise inversion)
       Elvis Operator:
            ?: (Elvis operator, used for null safety
       Safe Call Operator:
            ?. (Safe call operator, used for safe navigation when dealing with nulls)
